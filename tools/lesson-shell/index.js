/* ===========================================================================
   lesson-shell — the shared lesson shell every demo in the tour is built on.

   ONE CANONICAL COPY, POINTED AT. A demo's build.js requires this module and
   injects what it returns; nothing is vendored into the demo folder. That is
   what stops the nine-copies credit-pill problem from coming back: change the
   pill here, rebuild, and every demo has the new pill.

   THIS IS A BUILD-TIME DEPENDENCY, NOT A RUNTIME ONE. The built index.html
   stays a single self-contained file with zero <script src> and zero
   <link href> — the kit's CSS is inlined into it at build time. CONTRACT.md's
   self-containment requirement is about the BUILT FILE, not about where the
   sources live (orchestrator ruling, 2026-09-15; CONTRACT says "the build must
   be reproducible from the committed sources" and does not say the sources
   must sit inside the demo folder).

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   HOW TO ADOPT IT — the five-minute version

   1. Your demo needs `src/` + `build.js` (template part A10). Move your
      sources in: src/template.html, src/app.js, src/styles.css (your ACTIVITY
      styles only — the shell's are here), src/demo-guide.html, plus whatever
      model/engine files you have.

   2. In src/template.html <head>, three style blocks in this order:

          <style> __SHELL_CSS__ </style>   <- tokens.css + shell.css, from here
          <style> __CSS__ </style>         <- your activity CSS
          <style> __GUIDE_CSS__ </style>   <- lifted from your guide

      Placeholder spelling: in a CSS or JS context each name is wrapped in a
      block comment and in an HTML context in an HTML comment — so the four
      markers a template actually carries are the slash-star forms of
      __SHELL_CSS__, __CSS__, __GUIDE_CSS__ and __SHELL_JS__, plus the
      arrow-bracket forms of __SHELL_STAMP__ and __GUIDE__. (They are spelled
      bare here because a slash-star marker inside this comment would end it.)

      Order matters twice. Your CSS comes after the shell's so you can
      override any shell rule without !important. The guide's comes last
      because .guide-scope p and .lesson-dialog-body p have equal specificity,
      so the guide's rules must be the later ones to win inside the notes.

   3. Copy the markup you need from partials.html and fill in every ALL-CAPS
      slot. Keep the class names exactly — a reviewer greps for them, and
      check-shell.js refuses a built file with a placeholder left in it.

   4. In build.js:

          const shell = require('../tools/lesson-shell');
          const gc = require('../tools/lesson-shell/guide-contract');
          ...
          html = gc.injectOnce(html, SHELL_CSS_MARKER, shell.css());
          html = gc.injectOnce(html, STAMP_MARKER, shell.stamp());
          const guide = gc.extractGuide(read('src/demo-guide.html'));
          html = gc.injectOnce(html, GUIDE_CSS_MARKER, guide.css);
          html = gc.injectOnce(html, GUIDE_MARKER, guide.html);
          gc.assertNoExternalRefs(html, ['demo-guide.html']);
          gc.assertNoRuntimeLoads(html);

      ion-flight/build.js is the worked example — copy it and change the file
      list. It names every marker literally.

   5. Wire the shell's behaviour with `shell.behaviourScript()` injected at
      the __SHELL_JS__ marker — dialogs, the stage tablist keyboard,
      presentation mode, the A6 check cards and Reset. It needs no
      configuration beyond the ids partials.html already uses. Your own app.js
      handles the activity, and calls `window.lessonShell.selectStage(n)` if it
      wants to drive the tabs itself.

   6. REQUIRED, not optional: your app.js listens for `lessonreset` and puts
      the activity back to its first-load state. The shell restores only what
      the kit owns; it cannot know what your activity holds. A demo with no
      reset handler is an incomplete adoption and check-shell.js fails it.

   7. `node build.js && node tools/pdf.mjs && node build.js --check` and then
      `node ../tools/lesson-shell/check-shell.js <slug>`.

   ADOPTING.md beside this file is the long version — what the shell owns,
   what the demo owns, what to DELETE when converting a demo that predates the
   kit, the two events, and the full reset contract. Read it before a retrofit;
   this head comment is the five-minute version of it.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE STAMP. `stamp()` returns an HTML comment carrying the kit version AND a
   short hash of the kit's CSS. check-shell.js compares both against the kit on
   disk, so a demo whose index.html was built before a kit change FAILS rather
   than silently drifting. That is the back-propagation guarantee: you cannot
   change the kit and leave fifteen demos on the old one without a check going
   red.

/* Bump on any change to tokens.css, shell.css or behaviourScript(). The css
   hash catches the change even if this is forgotten; the version is what a
   human reads in a diff.

   v2 (2026-09-16): Reset became in-place — no page reload — and the
   `lessonreset` event it dispatches is a required part of every demo. The css
   hash is UNCHANGED by that edit, because the change is entirely in
   behaviourScript(), which is exactly the case this version number exists to
   catch.

   v3 (2026-09-16): the batched unfreeze. Six changes:
     1. `window.lessonShell.resetting` is exposed — ADOPTING.md §4 promised it
        and the kit did not provide it.
     2. `.lesson-strip .echo` no longer inherits the card label's uppercase, so
        a captured prediction stops rendering as SHOUTING.
     3. THE A2 STAGE INTRO IS COLLAPSIBLE AT PHONE WIDTH (operator ruling,
        2026-09-16). See the intro-disclosure section of behaviourScript().
     4. The `stagechange`-before-`lessonreset` ordering is DELIBERATELY KEPT;
        (1) is the fix for it. Rationale in the Reset comment below.
     5. ADOPTING.md gains the navy-vs-light panel convention.
     6. The shared A6 check-card handler no longer hardcodes one demo's
        wrong-answer sentence. It reads the lead from the card's own
        data-correct-lead / data-wrong-lead, defaulting to demo-neutral words.
        v2 shipped ion-flight's "Not what the detector showed." into every
        built demo, so learners met a sentence about a mass-spectrometer
        detector in check cards that had nothing to do with detectors.
        (Measured at 8 demos when this was written; the count rises with each
        merge and is a floor, not a total. The fix is count-independent.)
     7. `.hidden` becomes a RESERVED kit class backed by a real rule. Five
        demos had independently written the identical
        `.hidden { display: none !important }`, and a retrofit that correctly
        deletes the demo's chrome stylesheet took the rule with it while the
        JS kept toggling the class — panels rendered stacked, with every
        static check green. check-shell.js fails a demo that redefines it.
   The css hash DOES change this time (2, 3 and 7 all touch shell.css), which
   is what forces the fleet rebuild. That is intended. */

   would collapse the intro only for demos adopted AFTER this change, and would
   need eight already-merged demos to be hand-edited to catch up. Building it
   in behaviourScript() means every demo inherits it from the rebuild the stamp

   The shell's own behaviour. Kept here rather than in a .js file the demo
   copies, for the same reason the CSS is: one copy, pointed at.

   What it owns:
     * the three dialogs (Guide, Settings, Details) and the presenter notes,
       with swap-not-stack, Escape, backdrop click and focus return;
     * the Guide opening on load;
     * the stage tablist: click, Arrow/Home/End with roving tabindex, and the
       URL hash (#stage-2). A disabled tab is skipped by the keyboard and
       clamped to by the hash — see the note in selectStage;
     * presentation mode (body.presenter) and the header Notes button;
     * the A6 check cards: aria-pressed, per-option feedback from
       data-feedback, and nothing scored;
     * Reset — IN PLACE, with no page reload (operator ruling 2026-09-16). It
       restores every piece of kit-owned chrome from a snapshot taken at first
       load and then dispatches `lessonreset`.

   What it does NOT own: the activity. A demo's app.js listens for two events
   on document — `stagechange` to react to a tab change, and `lessonreset` to
   put its own state back. The second is REQUIRED; see the Reset section below
   and ADOPTING.md.

   It exposes window.lessonShell =
     { selectStage, setPresentation, reset, flags, onReset }.

  /* ---- A2 intro disclosure: collapsible stage intro at phone width ------
     Operator ruling, 2026-09-16: "collapsible intro at phone width."

     THE MEASUREMENT IT ANSWERS. At 320px the full A2 intro (eyebrow, stage
     title, stage question, "Before you start" refresh, then the three-card
     Predict/Try/Takeaway strip) runs 726-775px against a 568-578px viewport —
     the intro alone is more than one whole screen — and it put
     zero-to-unbeatable's Train button 1979px down and ion-flight's Run button
     2327px down, i.e. 4.1 screens. Measured on both demos before this change;
     the cost is a property of the template, not of either demo.

     WHAT COLLAPSES, AND WHAT NEVER DOES. Only the lesson strip is MOVED behind
     the toggle (it is the expensive part: 232-359px, up to half the intro) and
     the refresh is hidden by a CSS :has() rule rather than moved, so the
     desktop grid keeps byte-identical geometry. The eyebrow, the h2 and the
     stage question always stay visible: the stage question is the one line
     that orients, and the h2 is the aria-labelledby target of .stage-intro, so
     hiding it would strip that region's accessible name.

     DEFAULT COLLAPSED ON PHONES. The Guide already opens on load and already
     carries the orientation (the demo-level question, "where this sits", a
     step per stage), so a second orientation block between the learner and the
     activity is redundant rather than safer. Collapsed is not unoriented — the
     question is still on screen.

     NATIVE <details>, so Enter/Space, the disclosure role and the expanded
     state all come from the user agent rather than from an aria-expanded
     reimplementation.

     DESKTOP AND THE PROJECTOR ARE UNTOUCHED: shell.css hides the summary above
     480px and under body.presenter, and the element is forced open in both
     cases, so there is no toggle chrome and no geometry change. */

  /* ---- Reset: IN PLACE, no page reload -----------------------------------
     Operator ruling 2026-09-16. Until then Reset set a #reset hash and called
     location.reload(), which was trivially correct and threw the page away to
     get there: a reload discards a canvas mid-animation, re-runs every boot
     path, and on a slow projector laptop is a visible blank flash in front of
     a room. In-place costs a real contract instead, and this is it.

     THE DIVISION OF LABOUR — the whole contract in one sentence: if the kit
     named the class, the shell restores it; everything else is the demo's.

     WHAT THE SHELL GUARANTEES, in this order:
       1. 'onReset()' is consulted first and a 'false' return CANCELS the whole
          reset — nothing below runs. That is the veto path, unchanged from v1.
       2. Every open <dialog> closes — not only the shell's four. A demo may
          own one (two-winters' #item-details), and a dialog still open after a
          Reset is un-restored state the learner is looking straight at.
       3. Every stage tab goes back to its first-load chrome from the snapshot:
          'disabled' (so a gate re-locks), class (so 'complete' marks clear),
          title, and the .stage-mark glyph.
       4. Every A6 check card drops its aria-pressed answer and clears its
          feedback line.
       5. Every A2 .echo and A4 .obs-cue returns to its snapshotted first-load
          content. partials.html specifies both as empty on load; the snapshot
          is used rather than a blanket clear so a demo that authored something
          there keeps it.
       6. The A5 Details drawer goes back to showing stage 1, with its
          subtitle restored.
      6b. The A2 intro disclosure returns to its default for the CURRENT width
          (v3) — recomputed, never restored from the load-time snapshot, so a
          rotation between load and Reset cannot leave it half-open.
       7. selectStage(0) — stage 1, which also fires 'stagechange'.
       8. The page scrolls to the top.
       9. 'lessonreset' is dispatched on document.

     THE ORDER OF 7 AND 9 IS DELIBERATE, AND v3 KEPT IT. The stagechange at
     step 7 fires BEFORE lessonreset at step 9, so a stagechange handler that
     renders activity state paints the PRE-reset state into freshly reset
     chrome (missing-time hit exactly this). v3 fixes that with the
     'resetting' flag rather than by reordering, for three reasons:
       * this file and ADOPTING.md both GUARANTEE in writing that lessonreset
         fires last, "so the demo has the final word over any node the two both
         touch". Eight merged demos are written against that guarantee and five
         more builder lanes are in flight; reordering invalidates all of them
         silently.
       * reordering swaps a known hazard for a new one — the demo's lessonreset
         handler would then run before step 3 restored the tab chrome, so any
         handler reading tab state would read the post-session gates.
       * what-the-survey-missed established the hazard is inapplicable to
         render-only-from-actions designs; it bites the move-the-instrument
         pattern ion-flight and missing-time use. The flag fixes precisely that
         pattern WITHOUT changing any event order, so those demos keep working
         unmodified.

     WHAT THE SHELL DOES NOT TOUCH, deliberately:
       * PRESENTATION MODE. A presenter resets between rooms; re-shrinking the
         projector every time would be hostile. CONTRACT.md's wording too.
       * THE GUIDE. It does not reopen. A reset is not a fresh arrival, and the
         learner who pressed it has already read it.
       * THE ACTIVITY. The shell cannot know what a demo holds. That is what
         step 9 is for.

     WHAT THE DEMO MUST IMPLEMENT — required, not optional:

         document.addEventListener('lessonreset', () => {
           // every variable your module closes over, back to its initial value
           // every node your app.js generated, back to its first-load content
           // then re-render stage 1
         });

     'lessonreset' fires LAST, after the shell has finished, so the demo has
     the final word over any node the two both touch. It is not cancelable: the
     veto lives in onReset(), so there is exactly one place to refuse a reset.

     A demo that ships no handler silently keeps its answers, its generated
     DOM and its progress through a Reset that visibly moved everything else.
     check-shell.js fails a built file that carries no handler, with a negative
     control proving it is not merely matching the dispatch below. */
  function resetLesson() {
    /* v3: the flag ADOPTING.md §4 has promised since v2. True from BEFORE the
       onReset veto until AFTER 'lessonreset' has been dispatched, so a
       stagechange handler that genuinely has to paint can skip the one
       stagechange step 7 fires mid-reset:

           document.addEventListener('stagechange', e => {
             if (window.lessonShell.resetting) return;   // chrome only, mid-reset
             render(e.detail.index);
           });

       DO NOT write that guard into your 'lessonreset' handler. The flag is
       still true while 'lessonreset' runs, by design — your handler restores
       state and re-renders by calling your own render directly, which the
       guard above does not touch. Guarding lessonreset would suppress the very
       render the reset exists to perform.

       try/finally, so the veto path and any throw inside a listener both leave
       the flag false rather than wedging every later stagechange. */
