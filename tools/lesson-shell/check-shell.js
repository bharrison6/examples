   lesson-shell / check-shell.js — does this built index.html actually carry
   the kit, and the parts the template names?

     node tools/lesson-shell/check-shell.js <slug> [<slug> ...]
     node tools/lesson-shell/check-shell.js --all      every demo with a stamp

   Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail. Every failure names the template part at fault.

   WHAT IT PROVES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS HERE

   1. The STAMP is present, and its version AND css hash match the kit on disk.
      This is the back-propagation guarantee. Change the kit, and every demo
      built against the old one goes red until it is rebuilt — you cannot leave
      fifteen demos on a stale shell silently.

   2. Every A0 required token NAME appears. A demo that renamed --lite to --sky
      still renders, and would still pass a screenshot review, and would then
      quietly fork the palette. This is the A0 pass criterion, mechanized.

   3. The class vocabulary for A1, A2, A4, A5 and A6 appears. Presence is not
      quality — a reviewer still reads the copy — but absence is decisive, and
      it is the cheapest thing to get wrong when adopting the kit from the
      artifacts alone.

   4. No ALL-CAPS placeholder from partials.html survived into the built file.
      Adopting by copy-paste is the intended route, so shipping "STAGE TITLE"
      to the public site is the likeliest single failure of this whole pass.

   5. Only the six provenance words are used as kickers, and "unconfirmed" is
      never one of them — it is a qualifier in .k-qual that attaches to one of
      the six. (Orchestrator ruling 2026-09-15, on front-doors audit evidence:
      folding an honest "could not confirm" onto Illustrative renders it as
      INVENTED, a worse claim than the truth.)

   5b. Two STRUCTURAL label checks, which are the reliable half of "no
      unlabeled claim surface":
        * every .details-stage carries at least one kicker — the drawer's first
          fixed section IS the provenance statement, so a stage with none has
          skipped it;
        * every block marked .claim opens with a kicker.

      WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated rather than papered over: there is no
      reliable way to detect a claim in unmarked prose. "A longer tube always
      improves resolution" and "the tube is 1.50 m" are the same shape to a
      regex. So a builder who simply does not wrap a claim in .claim escapes
      check 5b entirely. That gap is real and it is why L1 review is a human
      lens reading src/, not a grep. A check that pretended to close it would
      pass vacuously and be worse than its absence, because it would retire
      the reviewer's attention. What 5b buys is that the marked surface cannot
      rot, and that a details-stage cannot ship with no provenance at all.

   6. Zero <script src> and zero <link href> to anything but a same-folder
      hyperlink: the built file is self-contained (CONTRACT.md).

   7. The credit pill's text is EXACTLY the fleet spec, with no suffix.

   8. The demo IMPLEMENTS THE RESET CONTRACT. Reset is in-place as of kit v2:
      the shell restores what the kit owns and dispatches `lessonreset`, and
      the demo restores its own activity. A demo with no handler keeps every
      answer through a Reset that visibly moved everything else, and no other
      check in this file or in any node suite can see that.

      SPECIFICITY, because this one could easily match itself: the shell's own
      behaviour script contains the string `lessonreset` — it dispatches the
      event — so a bare grep for the word passes on EVERY kit-built page,
      demo handler or not. The check looks for a LISTENER (or a non-null
      onReset veto), which the shell never installs, and --self-test carries a
      negative control that is the dispatch alone and must FAIL.

   9. No id is defined twice. This is the general form of the collision the
      two-winters lane hit: the kit's per-stage drawer is `#details`, which is
      also the most natural name for a demo's own per-item drill-down, and a
      duplicate id does not error — querySelector silently returns whichever
      came first, so the kit's drawer or the demo's popover quietly stops
      working. RESERVED_IDS below is the kit's list; this check is wider than
      that list on purpose, because a demo colliding with ITSELF breaks the
      same way. Scanned outside <script> blocks only: an id spelled inside
      generated markup in app.js is a string, not necessarily a live element,
      and guessing costs more than it buys. Stated rather than papered over —
      a collision created entirely at runtime by app.js is out of reach here
      and belongs to the browser pass.

   WHAT WAS TRIED AND NOT SHIPPED — an absence-claim lint (K4, 2026-09-16).
   After three absence-claim failures in the fleet program (one of them a demo
   shipping "One row is uneven, and it stays uneven" against four months of
   public docs), a warn-only lint for absolute-negative phrasing in visible
   learner copy was prototyped here and measured against all 14 built demos,
   with <script>, <style>, comments and <a> stripped. A BROAD word list
   (never / cannot / nowhere / there is no / does not exist / no version of /
   stays …) tripped 5/5 bait sentences and 6/8 legitimate ones, and produced
   183 warnings on a corpus that had already been corrected. A NARROW list
   tuned to prediction-shaped phrases got false positives down to 2/8 but
   missed 2/5 of the real failures — and one of its remaining false positives
   was the fleet's standard self-containment sentence ("This page runs no
   model and makes no network request"), which is a true, checkable negative
   that must never warn. There is no regex operating point between those two:
   the feature that separates "Google has no consumer-plan peer" from "there
   is no combined score" is WHOSE capability the sentence is about, and that
   is semantic. A lint that warns 183 times on compliant copy is tuned out on
   day one, and a lint that misses "Copilot cannot accept tracked changes"
   retires the reviewer's attention without earning it. The rule itself
   stands and lives in ADOPTING.md §5b; enforcing it is the L1 reviewer's
   lens, as it is for 5b's unmarked claims above.

   PROVING THE CHECKS ARE POTENT. --self-test runs every check against
   synthetic bait that should trip it, and fails if any check stays silent. A
   checker whose silence has not been tested is not evidence. Run it whenever
   you change this file:
