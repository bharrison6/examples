   Two Winters — the dataset.

   Every claim on screen comes from this file and every claim in this file
   carries a `src` that resolves to an entry in SOURCES. Nothing is here
   because it sounded right, and nothing is here because another demo in this
   repository already said it.

   `status` on any claim is one of:
     'primary'  — checked this build against the document itself: the paper,
                  the report's own text, the lab's own page, the official
                  results table.
     'reported' — a specific, retrievable secondary source that names its own
                  underlying scholarship. Used where the primary is a printed
                  book, a paywall, or a scanned page that could not be read.

   Nothing below 'reported' ships. What failed that bar is in CUT, at the
   bottom, because what a dataset refuses to include is part of its argument.

   Two standing cautions, both surfaced in the app rather than buried here:

     1. Winter date ranges are conventional, not crisp. Historians disagree,
        most sharply about when the second one ended. The bands are drawn
        soft-edged for that reason and the app says so out loud.

     2. There is no continuous, sourceable series of AI funding across
        seventy-six years. This demo therefore does not draw one. It shows
        four funding commitments it can actually source, in their original
        currencies, un-adjusted for inflation, and labels them as four points
        rather than a curve.

   ACT I — Guess the year.

   Ten real, sourced claims, shown with the speaker and the date hidden.
   The viewer guesses the year on a slider and picks a verdict. Deliberately
   mixed: five time-bounded promises, four contemporary or untimed assessments and one
   warning. Only a time-bounded forecast earns an outcome score. An assessment
   may be useful, mistaken, or misused without being a prediction.

   `kind` identifies the claim form, not whether it was correct:
     'promise'  — AI is nearly here / this will work
     'assessment' — a diagnosis of conditions at the time, not a forecast
     'warning'  — trouble is coming

   `verdict` is what happened:
     'no'    — it did not come true
     'yes'   — it came true
     'late'  — it came true, far outside the stated window
     'open'  — genuinely unresolved as of this build
