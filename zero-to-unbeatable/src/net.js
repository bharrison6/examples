   Zero to Unbeatable — Step 3's other memory: a neural network

   This file exists to change ONE thing about step 3 and nothing else.

   Step 3 already learns. Its rule is Act I's rule with the turn carried
   explicitly: a board picture is worth the best thing the player to move
   can reach from it, discounted, and a finished board is worth its
   result. That rule lives in nine.js and this file does not touch it.

   What this file replaces is WHERE the answer is kept.

     the table    39,366 numbers, one per (board picture, whose turn).
                  Reading is an array index. It can only give back a
                  value for a picture somebody has already written to;
                  everything else reads 0.00, which is indistinguishable
                  from "even".

     the network  a few thousand weights. Reading is a forward pass, so
                  it has an answer for EVERY picture, including ones it
                  has never been shown. Whether that answer is any good
                  is the thing the demo measures rather than asserts.

   Both are plugged into nine.js through the same three calls — at(),
   hits(), nudge() — so the training loop, the exploration, the move
   choice, the discount and the alpha schedule are shared code. If the
   two behaved differently for any other reason, the comparison this
   step makes would be worthless.

   The architecture
   ----------------
   29 inputs -> 32 rectified units -> 24 rectified units -> 1 number.
   1,777 weights against the table's 39,366 entries.

   The output is plain linear, and the read is clamped to [-1,1] because
   nothing can be worth more than a win. A squashing tanh was tried first
   and had to go: it interacts badly with the update below, which divides
   by the size of the gradient, and a saturating tanh drives that size to
   zero. Everything pinned to +1.00 within two hundred matches. The
   clamp does the same job without the singularity.

   The input is the board picture and nothing else:

     27  nine cells x three states (empty / X / O), one-hot
      2  whose turn it is, one-hot

   Exactly ten of those twenty-nine are 1 and the rest are 0, always. So
   the first layer is not a matrix multiply at all -- it is ten rows of
   W1 added together, which is why this runs at demo speed in plain JS
   on a phone. No tic-tac-toe knowledge is encoded: the network is not
   told what a line is, which cells share one, or that the centre is
   special. It gets nine independent squares and a turn bit.

   The update
   ----------
   The table's update is
                    U += alpha * (target - U)
   -- move this one number a fixed fraction of the way to the target.

   The network's update is written to do exactly that to its ANSWER:

        theta += alpha * (target - y) * grad(y) / (|grad(y)|^2 + eps)

   which is normalised least-mean-squares. To first order the new output
   for this position is y + alpha*(target - y): the same fraction of the
   way to the same target, from the same alpha schedule. The difference
   is not the size of the step, it is that a table's step moves one
   entry and a network's step moves every position that shares structure
   with this one. That is the entire lesson of the step, so it is worth
   the twenty lines it takes to make the two steps genuinely comparable
   instead of approximately comparable.

   Determinism
   -----------
   Same seed, same numbers, on every device, and this file gets there by
   never using a transcendental at all. IEEE +, -, *, / and sqrt are
   correctly rounded on every engine; Math.exp, Math.log and Math.tanh
   are not, and one differing last bit changes which story a run tells.
   So: weights initialised uniform from the mulberry32 stream (a normal
   sampler would need a logarithm), rectifiers for the hidden units (a
   comparison and a multiply), and a linear output. Where a transcendental
   IS unavoidable, glass-box/src/engine.js builds its own from
   polynomials over IEEE ops; that is the house solution and the reason
   this file was written to avoid needing it.
