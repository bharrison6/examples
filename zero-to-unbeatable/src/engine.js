   Zero to Unbeatable — learning engine

   Everything the agent knows lives in ONE table of numbers indexed by
   board position. There is no strategy in this file. Nothing anywhere
   says "take the centre", "block a row", "corners are good". The only
   information that ever enters the table is the result of a finished
   game: win = +1, draw = 0, loss = -1.

   Representation
   --------------
   A board is a base-3 integer. Cell i holds 0 (empty), 1 (X) or 2 (O),
   and the board's code is  sum(cell_i * 3^i).  There are 3^9 = 19,683
   codes, so every lookup is a plain array index and a whole training
   burst is a few million array reads.

   What is learned
   ---------------
   AFTERSTATE VALUES.  V[c] is the value of the position that exists
   immediately after somebody moved into it, from the point of view of
   the player who just moved. One table serves both players and both
   roles, because the position itself says whose turn it is: equal mark
   counts means X is to move, otherwise O is.

   The update (off-policy, negamax form of one-step TD / Q-learning):

       if the move just made won the game       target = +1
       else if the board is full                target =  0
       else                target = -gamma * max over the opponent's
                                     replies of V[reply]

   The third line is the whole trick. My position is worth exactly what
   the best thing my opponent can do to me is worth to them, negated.
   Using max rather than the reply the opponent actually played makes
   the update off-policy, so heavy random exploration during training
   does not permanently poison the values it converges to.

   Nothing in the update calls a rule-of-thumb. WINNER[] is consulted
   only to decide whether a game has ENDED and what the reward is --
   that is the reward signal, not strategy.
