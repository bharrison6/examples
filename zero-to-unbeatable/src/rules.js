   Zero to Unbeatable — Step 1: the hand-written rules

   This file is the opposite of engine.js in every way that matters, and
   that contrast is the point of the first step of the demo.

   engine.js contains no tic-tac-toe knowledge at all. It has a table of
   numbers and a rule for changing them, and the skill appears out of
   twenty thousand games. This file contains nothing BUT tic-tac-toe
   knowledge, all of it written down in advance by a person, and it has
   played zero games. It is an if/else ladder, checked in order, first
   match wins:

     1  Win              a line with two of mine and an empty third
     2  Block            a line with two of yours and an empty third
     3  Fork             a square that makes two threats at once
     4  Block the fork   deny you the same, by taking the square or by
                         making a threat you are forced to answer
     5  Centre           the square on four lines
     6  Opposite corner  you are in a corner, take the one across
     7  Empty corner     three lines each
     8  Empty side       whatever is left

   That ladder is Newell and Simon's, from their 1972 tic-tac-toe
   program, and versions of it have been retyped into introductory
   programming courses ever since. Most people would call it AI. It is
   worth being blunt that for a board this small it is also the BETTER
   piece of engineering: it is two hundred lines instead of a table of
   19,683 numbers, it answers instantly, it needs no training run, and
   you can read it and check it. Learning earns its keep when nobody can
   write the rules down -- not here.

   Two things this file must provide that a plain rule bot would not:

   WHY.  Every decision comes back with the rule that fired and the
   squares that triggered it, so the app can say "Rule 2 - Block: you had
   two in the top row" instead of just moving. The logic being visible is
   the whole request.

   A DEPTH DIAL.  Run only the first N rules and the rest are switched
   off. Two rules -- win and block -- is what most people write first,
   and it loses. Eight cannot be beaten. Both claims are checked by the
   same exhaustive search that checks the learned agent, in
   OG.verifyPolicy, because a demo that proves one side and asserts the
   other is not making the comparison it says it is.

   Ties inside a rule (two free corners, say) are broken by coin flip
   from a seeded stream, exactly as the learned agent breaks ties, so a
   rehearsed run reproduces. The verifier branches over the whole tie
   set rather than one pick, so the proof covers every flip.
